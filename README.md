### Hi I'm Hanna-Marii ðŸ‘‹

I am currently studying at Tartu Rakenduslik KolledÅ¾ to become a junior software developer. Before that I worked as a graphic designer for 5 years.

My passion motivates me to stay focused on getting better and better at the things I do. I love challenges and problem-solving. Besides coding I am skilled at graphic design and photography. You can check those out below in my e-portfolio.
