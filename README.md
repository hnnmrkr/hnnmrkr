### Hi I'm Hanna-Marii ðŸ‘‹

I am currently studying at University of Tartu (design thinking and digital marketing). In 2024 I graduated from Tartu Rakenduslik kolledÅ¾ and became a front-end developer. Before all that I worked as a graphic designer for 5 years.

My passion motivates me to stay focused on getting better and better at the things I do. I love challenges and problem-solving. Besides coding I am skilled at graphic design and photography.
